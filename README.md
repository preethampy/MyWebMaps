# MyWebMaps
This is a very intresting project,we will be using folium library and some functions and methods of pandas to create a webmap that shows you the population of india in different states with some information added to each state in a neat way.This project can be done by any begginer with minimum basic knowledge of python.If you are a begginer and to know how it works or how i build this,then please clone it and run it directly on any computer.I have added detailed comments so that everyone can understand what each step will do.You are welcome to make changes or find bugs and let me know after.
